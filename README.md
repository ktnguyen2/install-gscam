# install-ros-camera-nodes
Text files containing terminal commands to install two types of ROS camera nodes: gscam and realsense.

Redtail used gscam, but since we are using realsense cameras, we will test with realsense too.

These nodes were used with the Intel RealSense Camera VF0800 (same type as F200).

Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, ROS version: Kinetic Kame
